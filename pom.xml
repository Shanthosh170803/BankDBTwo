its happy to see that all the code works properly and no errors occurs now.
Now i need to make one small update in user dashboard, user will able to see the leaderboard for each quiz listed in the table.
user will able to see the leaderboard for a quiz and also the user's position in that leaderboard.
if multiple user has same result in the leaderboard , sort them based on their name
i will give you the user dashboard.jsp file , read it and generate the updated code
if you need further clarification , then ask me the questions and then start generating the codes.
===dashboard.jsp===
<%@ page import="quizportal.model.User" %>
<%
    User user = (User) session.getAttribute("user");
    if (user == null) {
        response.sendRedirect(request.getContextPath() + "/index.jsp");
        return;
    }
%>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>User Dashboard</title></head>
<body>
<h2>Welcome, <%= user.getName() %></h2>
 
<table>
<tr>
    <td><a href="<%=request.getContextPath()%>/user/quizzes">Take Quiz</a></td>
    <td><a href="<%=request.getContextPath()%>/user/history.jsp">Attempt History</a></td>
    <td><a href="<%=request.getContextPath()%>/user/logout">Logout</a></td>
</tr>
</table>
 
</body>
</html>
